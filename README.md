# Artisanal E-Commerce Platform

Welcome to the Artisanal E-Commerce Platform project! This repository contains the documentation for the first phase of our project, where we outline the problem statement and design thinking principles for building an artisanal e-commerce platform using IBM Cloud Foundry.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to create an e-commerce platform that connects skilled artisans with a global audience. The platform will offer features like secure shopping carts, payment gateways, and a seamless user experience. Both artisans and customers will benefit from this platform.

## Design Thinking

In this phase, we have identified key design principles to guide the development of the platform:

- **Platform Design:** We aim to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly layout, with dedicated sections for product categories, individual product pages, shopping carts, checkout, and payments.

- **Product Showcase:** We plan to develop a robust database to efficiently manage product information, including images, descriptions, prices, and categories.

- **User Authentication:** Users, including artisans and customers, will be able to create accounts and access the platform. User profiles will be implemented to showcase work and track order history.

- **Shopping Cart and Checkout:** We will provide a smooth shopping experience from cart to checkout by implementing features like adding/removing items from the cart and a well-structured checkout process.

- **Payment Integration:** Secure payment gateways will be integrated to facilitate safe transactions, offering various payment methods.

- **User Experience:** The platform will prioritize a positive and intuitive user experience, including responsive design, search functionality, feedback/support mechanisms, performance optimization, and thorough testing.

## Next Steps

The next phases of the project will include development, testing, and deployment to bring this concept to life. We encourage contributors and collaborators to join us in building this artisanal e-commerce platform.
